# 📱 Sentiment Analysis on BCA Mobile App

This project focuses on analyzing user sentiment toward the **BCA Mobile Banking Application** using reviews from the Google Play Store. By leveraging the **IndoBERT** model, we classify user feedback into **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative** sentiments to gain insights into user perception and identify areas for improvement.
